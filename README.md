Code used in my PhD Thesis

Superenhancers: code used to compare human craniofacial superenhancers to superenhancers identified in other tissues, including select tissue and cell types analyzed by dbSuper and human embryonic heart, identified in our group. This repository also contains code used to call superenhancers using the human 18-state model and comparison to superenhancers identified with the mouse 18-state model.
